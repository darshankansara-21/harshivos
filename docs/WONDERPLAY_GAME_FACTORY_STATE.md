# WonderPlay — Game Factory State

**Mandatory resume file.** On a new context: READ THIS FIRST, then resume from "NEXT EXACT ACTION". Never restart the sprint.

- **HEAD at last update:** (see git — Add It Up/Steady Hand/Kindness Match batch, round 3 complete) == origin/main (clean)
- **Version:** 1.0.42+43 (HELD — no bump during factory; release builds are LAST)
- **Updated:** 2026-10-04
- **Tests:** 155 pass · **Analyze:** 112 info / 0 warnings / 0 errors
- **Catalog:** 72 games + 20 sensory toys
- **REFACTOR_COMPLETE:** true — `arcade_games.dart` is now a thin library shell (imports + 39 `part 'arcade/<name>_game.dart';` directives + shared `_Shell`/`_Emit`). Each game lives in its own file under `lib/features/play/toys/arcade/`. All files share ONE library scope via `part`/`part of`, so private symbols (`_Shard`@brick_break, `_paintPolyShape`@sorting_train) stay visible with ZERO renames and ZERO behavior change. **To add a game:** create `lib/features/play/toys/arcade/<name>_game.dart` starting with `part of '../arcade_games.dart';` (NO imports in part files), add one `part 'arcade/<name>_game.dart';` line to `arcade_games.dart`, keep shared infra in `arcade_games.dart`. Then wire the 6 sites. No need to load the monolith anymore.
- **Note:** build machine pub-get NETWORK-STALLS hard on fresh terminals (file stuck 2642 bytes). `.dart_tool/package_config.json` persists on disk across sessions, so `flutter test --no-pub` / `flutter analyze --no-pub` work even in a FRESH terminal — use them directly, do NOT wait on pub get. `flutter analyze --no-pub` itself can take 8s–100s depending on machine load. ToyCategory = {sensory,fidget,arcade,creative,calm,learning,communication,lifeSkills} (NO 'puzzle'). ToyEngagement = {endless,deep,quick}. COMMON WARNING: a declared-but-unread field (e.g. `_turn`, `_rnd`) in a new game → remove it.
- **PART-SCOPE GOTCHA (critical):** every part file shares ONE library scope, so ALL top-level private names (classes/mixins) must be UNIQUE across every `arcade/*.dart` file. A new game's painter/helper CANNOT reuse a name already used by another game (e.g. `_BasketPainter` collided between basketball + counting_baskets). get_errors does NOT catch this; `flutter test` fails with "'_X' is already declared in this scope". Name painters distinctly (`_SoccerPainter`, `_FruitBasketPainter`, `_StarPathPainter`, ...).
- **Device QA:** BLOCKED (phone off USB since sprint #3; needs physical replug). Not sprint-ending — continue implementation; run accumulated QA when device returns.

## Build/terminal facts (critical)
- Flutter 3.44.0 at C:\src\flutter; run from `c:\src\lifelens\harshivos` with `$env:Path += ';C:\src\flutter\bin'`.
- Machine SEVERELY overloaded: full `flutter test` ~15s but `flutter analyze` ~7–100s; sync terminals WEDGE after builds (return no output) — recover with a fresh **async** `run_in_terminal`.
- Build logs via `*> file` are UTF-16LE → read with `Get-Content -Encoding Unicode`.
- Analyze warning/error count: match `^\s*(warning|error) -` (DASH, not bullet •). The bullet regex prior sprints used was WRONG and hid real warnings.
- `get_errors` lags on cross-method refs → ALWAYS `flutter test` after multi-edit.
- Timer-free one-shot pop = `TweenAnimationBuilder` keyed to a state string (no pending-timer test failures). Avoid `Future.delayed` in game states.
- ToyTicker `onTick(dt)` skips dt>=0.1 → tests must pump <0.1s / 90ms steps.

## New-game wiring = 6 sites (every new game)
1. Implementation in the right toys file (`arcade_games.dart` / `mini_games.dart` / `goal_games.dart`) — ToyTicker + `_Emit` juice + `_Shell` start card.
2. `lib/features/play/toy_registry.dart` — `toyBuilders` entry.
3. `lib/models/toy_meta.dart` — ToyMeta (`implemented: true`).
4. `lib/features/universe/universe_catalog.dart` — UniverseToy + add to a discovery rail (e.g. `arcadeToys()`).
5. `lib/features/universe/game_thumb.dart` — `painted` Set id + switch case + `_<id>` thumbnail painter.
6. `test/catalog_integrity_test.dart` gameIds + `test/arcade_games_test.dart` smoke test.
`catalog_integrity_test` requires each gameId: in toyBuilders + kToyUniverseById(working) + kToyCatalog(implemented) + listed in gameIds.

## Existing catalog (source of truth = toyBuilders) — 30 GAMES

## NEXT EXACT ACTION
Build round 4 in two batches (Skee Ball + Tone Match + Odd One Out, then Bigger Number + Balance Ball + Calm Choices), each a NEW part file in `lib/features/play/toys/arcade/` (`part of '../arcade_games.dart';`) with a matching `part` line. UNIQUE painter/helper names (part-scope shared). game_thumb.dart is SEPARATE — inline thumbnails, no arcade privates. Only use REAL Flutter APIs (no `Rect.fromCenterAndSize`). If the Play `experience_catalog.dart` capacity is ever exceeded again, raise it. Wire all 6 sites each; `flutter test --no-pub` + `flutter analyze --no-pub`; commit; update this file. Then auto-generate round 5 and keep going nonstop.
