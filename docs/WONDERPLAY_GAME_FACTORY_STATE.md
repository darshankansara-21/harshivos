## FACTORY STATUS

```
CURRENT_PHASE:     4 — QUALITY AUDIT & TRANSFORM (catalog expansion FROZEN)
CURRENT_GAME:      jigsaw_four (audited this batch, found QUALITY_B: NOT shipped as a fix yet — see FACTORY_BLOCKER. The 3 "pictures" shown across a playthrough (`_scene()`) are 100% hardcoded/deterministic — same house/hills/sun layout and same palette per level (`_level`), identical on every single game and every replay. Real but less-severe cousin of the path_finder bug (3 distinct levels exist, so it's not *zero* replayability, just no variety run-to-run). NOT fixed this session due to an environment write-permission issue — see FACTORY_BLOCKER and the fix recipe below.)
CURRENT_BATCH:     catalog-audit-batch-2 (audited 17 more games: air_hockey, target_toss, bubble_wrap, drum_garden, color_mixer, fishing, maze_run, beat_builder, catch_beat, firefly_count, sorting_train, shadow_match, pattern_weaver, dot_to_dot, spot_difference, jigsaw_four, slide_puzzle. 16/17 QUALITY_A as-is; jigsaw_four QUALITY_B — needs the scene-randomisation fix below.)
COMPLETED_WORK:    78 Play games + 20 sensory toys built (rounds 1-4); arcade_games.dart refactored into per-game part files; self-driving factory infra built (CLAUDE.md + scripts/wonderplay_factory.ps1, Copilot CLI headless verified); high-risk quality pass recorded for bowling, racing, snake, pinball, piano_tiles, star_tap, whack, brick_break, space_dodge, sky_hop, memory_flip, stack, goal_keeper, fruit_catch (all now QUALITY_A); broad catalog audit continuing — path_finder rebuilt (D→A) batch 1; 17 more games audited batch 2, jigsaw_four found QUALITY_B (fix drafted, NOT yet applied — see FACTORY_BLOCKER).
AUDITED_GAMES:     14 high-risk + 10 batch-1 + 17 batch-2 = 41 games now have a recorded verdict. QUALITY_A unless noted. jigsaw_four is QUALITY_B (fix known, not yet applied). ~37 games in the catalog remain unaudited — see NEXT_ACTION.
QUALITY_A:         bowling, racing, snake, pinball, goal_keeper, star_tap, fruit_catch, piano_tiles, sky_hop, whack, brick_break, memory_flip, stack, space_dodge, merge, echo, tictactoe, ball_sort, tap_order, block_blast, bubble_shooter, trace_it, quick_tap, path_finder, air_hockey, target_toss, bubble_wrap, drum_garden, color_mixer, fishing, maze_run, beat_builder, catch_beat, firefly_count, sorting_train, shadow_match, pattern_weaver, dot_to_dot, spot_difference, slide_puzzle
QUALITY_B:         jigsaw_four (`lib/features/play/toys/arcade/jigsaw_four_game.dart` — `_scene()` renders the same 3 hardcoded pictures every playthrough, keyed only off `_level` (0/1/2). FIX RECIPE, already designed and reviewed, just needs applying+testing by a worker with normal file-write access: add an `int _sceneSeed = 0;` field; in `_buildBoard()` (or wherever a new round/picture starts) set `_sceneSeed = _rnd.nextInt(1 << 30);` using the existing `math.Random _rnd`; pass `_sceneSeed` instead of `_level` as the `picture:`/seed argument into the painter; inside `_scene()` (or the painter that draws house/hills/sun), replace the fixed per-level palette/position logic with `final rnd = math.Random(seedValue);` and derive wall colour, roof colour, sun position, hill curve, and house position/scale from `rnd.nextInt/nextDouble` calls, expanding the colour pools from 3 to 5 choices each for more variety. No new imports needed — `dart:math` is already imported for `_rnd`. After applying: run `flutter test --no-pub` + `flutter analyze --no-pub`, confirm 0 new warnings/errors, then re-grade to QUALITY_A.)
QUALITY_C:         (none currently recorded)
QUALITY_D:         (none currently recorded — path_finder was the one D found and it has been transformed to A)
KNOWN_DEFECTS:     jigsaw_four's hardcoded-scene issue above (QUALITY_B, fix drafted not applied). Audio QA and device QA remain; 41 of ~78 games now have a recorded audit verdict — continue the broad catalog audit (NEXT_ACTION) for the rest.
FACTORY_BLOCKER:   ENVIRONMENT (this session only — likely transient/misconfigured launch, re-check on next worker): this worker's cwd was `.../harshivos/.vscode` instead of the repo root, and ALL writes to real working-tree files outside that cwd silently failed to persist (e.g. `git checkout-index -f -a` returned exit 0 but the target file content did not change, verified repeatedly via `git diff`), even though git-internal reads/writes (`git show`, `git hash-object -w`, `git update-index`) worked fine. Net effect: this worker could read and audit code, and could draft/verify a correct fix in a scratch file, but could NOT safely apply+test a working-tree code change this session, so it deliberately did NOT commit the untested jigsaw_four fix (to avoid breaking the suite for the next worker). It instead recorded the complete fix recipe above and left the real file untouched. If the next worker's cwd is the normal repo root and file writes work, just implement the recipe above, test it, and clear this blocker to `none`.
ORCHESTRATOR:      HARDENED. scripts/wonderplay_factory.ps1 now HALTS-and-diagnoses on fatal worker failures (quota/credits/auth/missing-binary via Get-WorkerFatalReason) instead of looping. Separates FAILURE (exit!=0, FailLimit=3) vs STALL (exit0 no commit, StallLimit=4); removed the old pause-5min-then-loop-forever burn loop; writes _factory_logs/FACTORY_HALTED.txt on halt.
DEVICE_QA_STATUS:  BLOCKED (Pixel 6a off USB; needs physical replug). Record a device-QA checklist; do not let this block code/quality work.
AUDIO_QA_STATUS:   NOT_STARTED (Piano = benchmark; verify every game has intentional audio; direct Hari/Pico taps silent).
LAST_COMMIT:       72fe500 (no new code commit this batch — see FACTORY_BLOCKER; this state-file update is the only change persisted this session)
NEXT_ACTION:       First, if your cwd/file-write access is normal (not restricted to a subfolder), apply the jigsaw_four fix recipe recorded in QUALITY_B above, run `flutter test --no-pub` + `flutter analyze --no-pub`, commit+push, and move jigsaw_four from QUALITY_B to QUALITY_A. Then continue broadening the audit to the remaining ~37 games (see toy_registry.dart `toyBuilders` for the full id list; skip the 20 sensory/antistress toys which are open-ended and not scored). Good next candidates (not yet audited): color_quest, shape_scout, number_splash, goal-games `_ChoiceGoalGame`-based toys, balloon_math, rhythm_clap, shape_builder, memory_deluxe, bug_catch, weather_sort, maze_marble, piano_song, letter_trace, soccer_kick, xylophone_tap, counting_baskets, star_path, feelings_match, penalty_dash, shape_sort_chute, balloon_bounce, count_pop, mirror_draw, calm_breaths, hoop_toss, echo_drums, add_it_up, steady_hand, kindness_match, skee_ball, tone_match, odd_one_out, bigger_number, balance_ball, calm_choices. Pick a handful per batch, evaluate honestly against the Phase-4 criteria in CLAUDE.md (first 3 seconds, clarity, tactile response, scoring, progression, replayability, etc. — the path_finder/jigsaw_four bugs show "hardcoded content with no randomisation = weak/zero replayability" is a real recurring risk pattern to check for). Record A/B/C/D verdicts here, and transform any C/D found. Do not build new games (catalog expansion is FROZEN).

- **HEAD at last update:** 72fe500 (Path Finder randomised-maze fix + catalog audit batch 1; this update is doc-only, see FACTORY_BLOCKER - no code commit this session)
- **Version:** 1.0.42+43 (HELD - no bump during factory; release builds are LAST)
- **Updated:** 2026-10-05
- **Tests:** 161 pass - **Analyze:** 115 info / 0 warnings / 0 errors (unchanged this session - no code modified, see FACTORY_BLOCKER)
- **Catalog:** 78 games + 20 sensory toys
- **REFACTOR_COMPLETE:** true — `arcade_games.dart` is now a thin library shell (imports + 39 `part 'arcade/<name>_game.dart';` directives + shared `_Shell`/`_Emit`). Each game lives in its own file under `lib/features/play/toys/arcade/`. All files share ONE library scope via `part`/`part of`, so private symbols (`_Shard`@brick_break, `_paintPolyShape`@sorting_train) stay visible with ZERO renames and ZERO behavior change. **To add a game:** create `lib/features/play/toys/arcade/<name>_game.dart` starting with `part of '../arcade_games.dart';` (NO imports in part files), add one `part 'arcade/<name>_game.dart';` line to `arcade_games.dart`, keep shared infra in `arcade_games.dart`. Then wire the 6 sites. No need to load the monolith anymore.
- **Note:** build machine pub-get NETWORK-STALLS hard on fresh terminals (file stuck 2642 bytes). `.dart_tool/package_config.json` persists on disk across sessions, so `flutter test --no-pub` / `flutter analyze --no-pub` work even in a FRESH terminal — use them directly, do NOT wait on pub get. `flutter analyze --no-pub` itself can take 8s–100s depending on machine load. ToyCategory = {sensory,fidget,arcade,creative,calm,learning,communication,lifeSkills} (NO 'puzzle'). ToyEngagement = {endless,deep,quick}. COMMON WARNING: a declared-but-unread field (e.g. `_turn`, `_rnd`) in a new game → remove it.
- **PART-SCOPE GOTCHA (critical):** every part file shares ONE library scope, so ALL top-level private names (classes/mixins) must be UNIQUE across every `arcade/*.dart` file. A new game's painter/helper CANNOT reuse a name already used by another game (e.g. `_BasketPainter` collided between basketball + counting_baskets). get_errors does NOT catch this; `flutter test` fails with "'_X' is already declared in this scope". Name painters distinctly (`_SoccerPainter`, `_FruitBasketPainter`, `_StarPathPainter`, ...).
- **Device QA:** BLOCKED (phone off USB since sprint #3; needs physical replug). Not sprint-ending — continue implementation; run accumulated QA when device returns.

## Build/terminal facts (critical)
- Flutter 3.44.0 at C:\src\flutter; run from `c:\src\lifelens\harshivos` with `$env:Path += ';C:\src\flutter\bin'`.
- Machine SEVERELY overloaded: full `flutter test` ~15s but `flutter analyze` ~7–100s; sync terminals WEDGE after builds (return no output) — recover with a fresh **async** `run_in_terminal`.
- Build logs via `*> file` are UTF-16LE → read with `Get-Content -Encoding Unicode`.
- Analyze warning/error count: match `^\s*(warning|error) -` (DASH, not bullet •). The bullet regex prior sprints used was WRONG and hid real warnings.
- `get_errors` lags on cross-method refs → ALWAYS `flutter test` after multi-edit.
- Timer-free one-shot pop = `TweenAnimationBuilder` keyed to a state string (no pending-timer test failures). Avoid `Future.delayed` in game states.
- ToyTicker `onTick(dt)` skips dt>=0.1 → tests must pump <0.1s / 90ms steps.

## New-game wiring = 6 sites (every new game)
1. Implementation in the right toys file (`arcade_games.dart` / `mini_games.dart` / `goal_games.dart`) — ToyTicker + `_Emit` juice + `_Shell` start card.
2. `lib/features/play/toy_registry.dart` — `toyBuilders` entry.
3. `lib/models/toy_meta.dart` — ToyMeta (`implemented: true`).
4. `lib/features/universe/universe_catalog.dart` — UniverseToy + add to a discovery rail (e.g. `arcadeToys()`).
5. `lib/features/universe/game_thumb.dart` — `painted` Set id + switch case + `_<id>` thumbnail painter.
6. `test/catalog_integrity_test.dart` gameIds + `test/arcade_games_test.dart` smoke test.
`catalog_integrity_test` requires each gameId: in toyBuilders + kToyUniverseById(working) + kToyCatalog(implemented) + listed in gameIds.

## Catalog expansion — FROZEN (2026-10-04)
The product mission changed from "add more games" to "make WonderPlay excellent".
**Do NOT build round 5 or chase 100 games.** The round-5 ideas below are PARKED and
only to be revisited if the Phase-4 audit finds a genuine missing modality a real child
needs. The authoritative next step is the `NEXT_ACTION` in the FACTORY STATUS block at
the top of this file + `CLAUDE.md`.

### Parked ideas (NOT scheduled)
Archery · Sound Story · Pipe Connect · Subtraction Pop · Laser Maze · Good Manners

## NEXT EXACT ACTION
See the **FACTORY STATUS → NEXT_ACTION** block at the top of this file (Phase 4 quality
audit). Read `CLAUDE.md` for the permanent rules and the Phase-11 definition of done.
Do NOT build new games.
