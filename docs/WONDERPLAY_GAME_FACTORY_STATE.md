# WonderPlay — Game Factory State

**Mandatory resume file.** On a new context: READ THIS FIRST, then resume from "NEXT EXACT ACTION". Never restart the sprint.

- **HEAD at last update:** ac99155 == origin/main (clean) — music/creative batch SHIPPED
- **Version:** 1.0.42+43 (HELD — no bump during factory; release builds are LAST)
- **Updated:** 2026-10-03
- **Tests:** 118 pass · **Analyze:** 112 info / 0 warnings / 0 errors
- **Catalog:** 35 games (30 + air_hockey, target_toss, bubble_wrap, drum_garden, color_mixer) + 20 sensory toys
- **Device QA:** BLOCKED (phone off USB since sprint #3; needs physical replug). Not sprint-ending — continue implementation; run accumulated QA when device returns.

## Build/terminal facts (critical)
- Flutter 3.44.0 at C:\src\flutter; run from `c:\src\lifelens\harshivos` with `$env:Path += ';C:\src\flutter\bin'`.
- Machine SEVERELY overloaded: full `flutter test` ~15s but `flutter analyze` ~7–100s; sync terminals WEDGE after builds (return no output) — recover with a fresh **async** `run_in_terminal`.
- Build logs via `*> file` are UTF-16LE → read with `Get-Content -Encoding Unicode`.
- Analyze warning/error count: match `^\s*(warning|error) -` (DASH, not bullet •). The bullet regex prior sprints used was WRONG and hid real warnings.
- `get_errors` lags on cross-method refs → ALWAYS `flutter test` after multi-edit.
- Timer-free one-shot pop = `TweenAnimationBuilder` keyed to a state string (no pending-timer test failures). Avoid `Future.delayed` in game states.
- ToyTicker `onTick(dt)` skips dt>=0.1 → tests must pump <0.1s / 90ms steps.

## New-game wiring = 6 sites (every new game)
1. Implementation in the right toys file (`arcade_games.dart` / `mini_games.dart` / `goal_games.dart`) — ToyTicker + `_Emit` juice + `_Shell` start card.
2. `lib/features/play/toy_registry.dart` — `toyBuilders` entry.
3. `lib/models/toy_meta.dart` — ToyMeta (`implemented: true`).
4. `lib/features/universe/universe_catalog.dart` — UniverseToy + add to a discovery rail (e.g. `arcadeToys()`).
5. `lib/features/universe/game_thumb.dart` — `painted` Set id + switch case + `_<id>` thumbnail painter.
6. `test/catalog_integrity_test.dart` gameIds + `test/arcade_games_test.dart` smoke test.
`catalog_integrity_test` requires each gameId: in toyBuilders + kToyUniverseById(working) + kToyCatalog(implemented) + listed in gameIds.

## Existing catalog (source of truth = toyBuilders) — 30 GAMES
All transformed across sprints 1–3 (see docs/GAME_QUALITY_WAR_ROOM.md) + Basketball/Mini Golf this sprint.

### EXISTING_CATALOG_COMPLETE
All 30 games meet the gameplay quality bar (clear in 5s · satisfying in 30s · evolves in 2min · real again-loop · feedback · scoring · progression · WonderPlay character). 6 device-verified; rest test-verified (device QA blocked). New-game factory UNLOCKED.

## NEXT EXACT ACTION
Build the next batch: **Fishing** (cast meter → wait → bite-timing tap → reel; rarity fish; score to win) and **Maze Run** (drag a dot through walls to the exit, collect keys, levels grow). Wire all 6 sites each (registry, toy_meta implemented:true, universe UniverseToy + arcadeToys rail, game_thumb painted-set+switch+painter, catalog_integrity gameIds, arcade smoke test). Run `flutter test` + `flutter analyze` (0 warn/0 err via `^\s*(warning|error) -`). Commit + push. Update this file. Then keep generating backlog (Beat Builder, Catch-the-Beat, Firefly Count, Sorting Train, Shadow Match, Tangram).
